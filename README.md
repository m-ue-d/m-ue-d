# :ghost:WHO THIS?

Hi visitor. My name is MÜD. I like working on fun projects with my friends <a href="https://github.com/FabianHummel">Fabian Hummel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lambdaspg">LambdaSpg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/atomeniuc">Alejandro Tomeniuc</a>. They're great, so check them out too! =)

I am a IT-fanatic that enjoys discovering new stuff. Working with friends is also very important to me.
(You can also find me on Soundcloud: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/m-ue-d">m-ue-d</a>)

## 🔭WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I am currently mainly working on a program called Squavy, which is a free Web DAW. Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/Squavy-DAW">Squavy-DAW</a> 🦑.

## 🤔WHAT ARE YOUR FUTURE PLANS?
Write better documentation on my projects. Finish some old projects. Write documentation on them. Other than that, i'll keep them secret 🤫!
