# :ghost:WHO THIS?

First of all, my name is MÃœD, not MUD:
(Pronounciation of Ãœ: say "ee", just like in Bee:honeybee:. While saying the sound, round your lips like an "O")

I am a IT-fanatic that enjoys discovering new stuff. Working with friends is also very important to me.

## ðŸ”­WHAT DOES HE DO?
I am currently working on cool stuff, but my greatest project yet is "Heast-Messenger", which is a collabration between <a href="https://github.com/FabianHummel">Fabian Hummel</a>,<a href="https://github.com/lambdaspg">LambdaSpg</a> and myself.

## ðŸ¤”WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK OF M.UE.D?
Well i dunno :satisfied:!
